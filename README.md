## Titanic Dataset
### Abstract
This report investigates the survival rate and its assosication to other factors among the Titanic passengers. 

### Summary
In this report, we investigated the relationship between the survival rates of the passengers and the variables age, class, gender. Our analysis provided us a strong evidence for the association between the survival rate and the variables gender & class. However, we could not find enough evidence to support the relationship between the survival rate and the age groups.
